## Portugal Wind Energy Production Forecast

The global energy landscape is complex and constantly evolving, includng the production, distribution, and use of energy resources. Energy is essential for industry, transportation, and daily life, with sources divided into renewable (inexhaustible) and non-renewable (finite) categories. Renewable sources like solar and wind have gained significant attention, but their production is affected by variable weather conditions, for this reason making accurate forecasting is crucial for optimal resource management. This study focuses on comparing different forecasting models (ARMA, Prophet, NeuralProphet, RNN, GRU, and LSTM) to predict wind energy production in Portugal. By evaluating these models using meteorological data and installed energy capacity, the goal is to identify the most accurate approach for forecasting energy from wind sources.
